  One day, I heard someone
 said: if you are alive,
 you cannot be bored in San
 Francisco.
  If you are not alive,
 San Francisco will bring
 you to life.

  Why? San Francisco city
 is where people are never
 more abroad than when
 they are at home.

  This will be my very last
 stop, then back the reality
 WORK! I'll enjoy every last
 moment!!!!
