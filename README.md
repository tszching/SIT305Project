# Henry comments 27/April
- This file needs directory explanation so I know where to find stuff. I won't be looking in an IDE. I'll be looking at files on a hard drive.
- Your changelog needs a lot of work. Missing tasks that were complete, hasn't said who did what task each day of work, etc.
- Your data hasn't progressed enough. You need to get to this very quickly, as you can't start building your game until you can at least load the levels/world of your game. So work on getting loading working (from data files) asap.
- There are many repeated files (readme, project directories, etc), so they overlap. Please delete / merge irrelevant files.


# == Description==

This is a group project 'Global treasure explorer' in developing a single player - text-based Role-playing game(RPG) in Xcode where users experiences to direct the main character to defeating or interacting the auto-moving objects in each level. The key rules users need to follow are: choosing different situation in defeating or avoiding enemies and discovering the Four treasures in each level. Once the user has discovered each of the Four treasures, they can progress to the next level. The game will feature three countries with three dedicated levels for the user to complete. 

The mobile game app development contains various functions such as menu options, game operation, location levels, achievement list and score record. As for further sub features hope to accomplish are the score, music and achievement.

They will be functioning in such as the using external data saving and displaying dat
The Purpose of this text-based RPG is to keep users entertainment and reducing their stress while they can learn the education in-game from the countries they explore.

1. Open 'Xcode' then go to 'File' on the top of Mac taskbar and press 'Open...'

2. Click on my folder 'SIT305Project-master' from where you downloaded > Project2 > Project2.xcodeproj > Open

3a. To turn on the iOS simulators and run the project, you need to: 
          a: Select a simulator from the top left where it has a little Xcode logo
          b: After choosing a simulator eg:  you pick iPhone 6

3b. Go to Product on the top of Mac taskbar and press 'Run' (Command R)- auto selected simulator for you


4. Orientation of Screen: 
          After simulator has been loaded, my project will auto pop-up and you can simplify click (Command + left arrow) or (Command + right arrow) on keyboard to change the rotating of your virtual Iphone.


5. You can now exploring my game - "Global treasure explorer"


# ==Directory Structure==

Directory Structure is where the coding files,assets images folders and all other relevant folders located on the left listbar.


# ==Game Data & Important Code==

1. Expand the grey triangle with a blue document logo in Project2 
2. Expand the Project2 folder
3. You then see all the ViewController.swift files = Different Screens
4. You will also see the Assets.xcassets where I stored all my images that have beeen applied to my template - the storyboard
5. Some .mp3 files are for the Sounds effects and background music 

Important Code:

My ViewController.swift files which included:
-JsonDataHandler.swift to read and write and update the game data through data.json 
-ObjectStates.swift to temporarily data store from AppDelegate for all the target objects.
-AchievementCell.swift show all taget objects data from detail.json
-Detail.json for the struture data on achievement screen
-ViewController.swift is the Menu page where you select to go to another page
-AboutViewController.swift is about the Project Descirption.
-LevelViewController.swift is the level selection before the game starts.
-SettingViewController.swift is the setting of the game eg: sounds effects, background music and user guideline etc.
-StartGameViewController.swift is the first level of the game which you will need to click the button to do the navigated and try to check and collect the important 4 treasures.
